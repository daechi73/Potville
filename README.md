# Potville

## gh-page: https://daechi73.github.io/Potville/

Originally a shop for selling ketching pots, changed into a retail shop that sells clothing,
eletronics, and jeweleries.

Created by using Vite React.js, this web application consists of 4 main webpages that can be accessed
through the nav bar.

- About page
- Cart page
- Home page
- Shop page
- and error page

The shopping item data is fetched from fakestoreapi.com and its returned promise throws and catches an error
if server error is returned and loading screen is added using the finally block.

It is a straight forward shopping application that won't need any guidance!
